# pressBlock3D

A Python library to create 3D printed *Type*. Instead of standard text, SVGs can be imported to created graphical Type.

Similar to [pressType3D](https://github.com/aguileraGit/pressType3D) for regular text.

Look at [theNounProject](https://thenounproject.com/) for SVGs or design your own with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

### Limitations
Currently only supports SVG paths.
